# Quantile-Regression-in-stata
quantile regression vs Ols regression.
how the number of total chronical conditions affect the total expeditures: OLS vs quantile regression.
the quantile regression produces different effects along the distribution of the dependent variable: for those who have low total expeditures the effect of total chronical conditions
is lower than for those who have higher expeditures.
Ols estimation doesn't account fot that.
